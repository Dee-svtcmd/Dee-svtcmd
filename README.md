# Mabuhay! 👋

I'm **D** — a student based in **Philippines 🇵🇭** with a growing interest for programming and a natural love for UI / design.  
Even though I’m still learning the ropes in coding, I enjoy practising UI design and building nice-looking, user-friendly interfaces.  
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## 🎯 What I’m Doing / What I’m Aiming For

- 🧑‍💻 **Current journey**: Learning programming (web development, UI / UX design, maybe experimenting with JavaScript/HTML/CSS or other languages).  
- 🌱 **What I love**: UI & interface design, visual styling, user-friendly experiences — but also learning how to make those designs come to life with code.  
- 🎯 **My goal**: To combine my UI/design sensibilities with coding skills — build clean, good-looking, functional applications and grow as a well-rounded developer.
